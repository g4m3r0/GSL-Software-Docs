## Quick Start

### Autopilot

The **Autopilot** feature will scrape all proxy sources and test the found proxies afterwards. Proxy Sources will be downloaded from GSL if they are missing. Working proxy server will be added to the Proxy List.

1. **Press on the Autopilot button** to automatically download a list of proxy source from GSL. Those source will automatically be scraped and the found proxy servers tested. Those proxy servers that are determined as working will be added to the _Proxy List_.

1. **Import** Proxy Sources (URLs) from file or clipboard to scrape proxies by clicking on the **Import** button.
2. **Scrape** the imported sources for proxies by clicking on the **Scrape** button (**Note:** Scraped proxies wont be tested automatically.).
3. **Test** the scraped proxies by clicking on the **Test** button.
4. **Export** the working proxies according to your needs by using the **Export** button.

#### **Test**

The **Test** feature allows to manually test proxy servers.

#### **Scrape**

The **Scrape** feature allows to manually scrape proxy source from the _Source List_ Proxy Source can also be downloaded the the GSL servers.

#### **Import**

The **Import** feature allows to manually import proxy servers or proxy source from either file or clipboard (_STRG+C_).

#### **Export**

The **Export** feature allows to manually export proxy servers or proxy source from either file or clipboard (_STRG+V_).

## Proxy Tester

**Proxy Buddy** is the fastest proxy tester on the market for Windows desktop or server systems. With socket-based multi-threading support, it can test more than 10.000 proxies every minute. It tests proxies for Google Pass (Google Search) and determines the country, speed, anonymity level, SSL support, and the used protocol (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, SOCK4, SOCKS5). The proxy servers' IP address will be checked for blacklisting in the _stopforumspam_ database as well.
