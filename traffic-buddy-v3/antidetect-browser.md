# Antidetect Browser

### What is the Antidetect Browser?

Every time you visit a website, your browser sends a collection of data called a "browser fingerprint." This fingerprint includes your operating system, browser type, screen resolution, language, installed fonts, and much more. Websites use this unique fingerprint to identify and track you, often without your consent.

The Antidetect Browser solves this problem by allowing you to create and manage multiple browser profiles, each with a completely unique and customizable fingerprint. This makes it appear as if each profile is a different person using a different computer, giving you control over your online identity.

### Key Features

* **Full Browser Isolation**: Each profile runs in its own sandboxed environment. Cookies, cache, local storage, and history are kept completely separate, preventing websites from linking your activities between profiles.
* **Fingerprint Customization**: Take control of your digital fingerprint. You can modify dozens of parameters, including:
  * Browser & Operating System (e.g., appear as Safari on a Mac)
  * Screen Resolution
  * User-Agent
  * Timezone and Language
  * WebGL and Canvas Fingerprints
* **Proxy Integration**: Easily route each profile's traffic through a different proxy. This masks your real IP address and makes it appear as if you are browsing from a different location.
* **Profile Management**: Create, save, and launch as many browser profiles as you need. Your sessions are saved, so you can pick up right where you left off.

### Common Use Cases

* **Managing Multiple Accounts**: Safely run multiple social media, e-commerce, or advertising accounts without them being linked and banned.
* **Web Scraping**: Gather data from websites without triggering anti-bot systems that block or serve false information to repeated requests from the same fingerprint.
* **Ad Verification**: Test how advertisements are displayed to users in different geographical locations or on different types of devices.
* **Enhanced Privacy**: Protect yourself from invasive tracking and data collection for a more private browsing experience.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How is this different from my browser's Incognito or Private mode?**

A: Incognito mode only prevents your browsing history and cookies from being saved on your computer. It does **not** hide your IP address or change your unique browser fingerprint. The Antidetect Browser masks both your IP (with a proxy) and your fingerprint, providing a much higher level of anonymity and isolation.

**Q: How can I verify that my fingerprint has changed?**

A: After launching a profile, you can visit a fingerprint-checking website to see what data your browser is exposing. Popular choices include:

* https://amiunique.org/
* https://fingerprint.com/

**Q: Do I need to provide my own proxies?**

A: Yes, the Antidetect Browser provides the functionality to use proxies, but you must acquire them from a third-party proxy provider.
