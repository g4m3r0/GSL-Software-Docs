The Proxy Settings in Traffic Buddy provide a feature to configure the use of a proxy server for website browsing. The application supports various proxy protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, Socks4, and Socks5. You can add new proxy servers by navigating to the "Proxy" option in the top menu strip.

For convenience, Traffic Buddy also offers the ability to download a list of pre-scraped and tested public proxy servers.

Additional settings provide enhanced control over your browsing experience. Features include the ability to disable non-functional proxies, verify proxy servers before engaging them with the web browser, and filter proxy servers by country, allowing users to exclude proxies from one or multiple countries.

We are also excited to announce that support for Tor proxies will be integrated into our system in the near future. This upcoming feature will provide our users with another layer of security and anonymity during web browsing.

The Browser Settings in Traffic Buddy provide users with the flexibility to modify various browsing preferences at a global level. These options include enabling or disabling the execution of JavaScript, controlling the loading of images, as well as setting the browser's locale and language. This feature ensures a more personalized and optimized browsing experience.
