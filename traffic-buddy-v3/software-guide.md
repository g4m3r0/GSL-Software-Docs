#### General Settings Tab

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Add a new Campaign: General Settings</p></figcaption></figure>

The General Settings tab contains the basic configuration options for your traffic campaign. Here you'll define the campaign's core parameters that determine its identity and scale.

**Campaign ID**

* An automatically generated unique identifier for your campaign
* Read-only field
* Used for tracking and referencing your campaign within Traffic Buddy

**Campaign Name**

* Enter a descriptive name for your campaign
* This name helps you identify your campaign in the campaign list
* Example: "Summer Sale Landing Page Traffic" or "Product Page Testing"
* Must be unique within your Traffic Buddy campaigns

**Maximum Concurrent Browsers**

* Defines how many browser instances can run simultaneously
* Each browser instance simulates one unique visitor
* Valid range: 1 to 1000 browsers
* Higher numbers generate more concurrent traffic but require more system resources
* Recommended: Start with a lower number and increase gradually based on your system's performance

**Maximum Number of Website Views**

* Sets the total number of page views the campaign will generate
* Campaign stops automatically when this number is reached
* Example: Setting this to 1000 means the campaign will stop after generating 1000 page views

üìù **Note:** Consider your system resources when setting concurrent browsers and maximum views. Higher numbers may require more powerful hardware.&#x20;

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Changes to these settings cannot be made while the campaign is running. Stop the campaign first to modify these parameters.

#### Traffic Origin Tab

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Add-Referrer.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Traffic Origin Configuration - Define how visitors reach your website</p></figcaption></figure>

The Traffic Origin Tab allows you to configure how visitors appear to arrive at your website. You can simulate different traffic sources that reflect realistic user behavior patterns.

You can configure multiple referrer sources that Traffic Buddy will cycle through during the campaign.

**1. Direct Traffic**

* Simulates visitors who type your URL directly into their browser
* No referrer information is sent
* Represents users who have bookmarked your site or received the link through messaging apps
* Toggle: Enable/Disable direct traffic

**2. Search Engine Traffic**

* Simulates visitors coming from search engine results
* Includes the search keyword in the referrer data
* Configuration fields:
  * Search Engine (e.g., Google, Bing)
  * Search Keyword(s)
* Example: A visitor searching "best running shoes" on Google

**3. Custom URL Referrers**

* Simulates visitors coming from specific websites
* Enter one URL per line
* Format: `https://www.example.com`
* Useful for simulating:
  * Social media traffic
  * Partner website referrals
  * Blog post references

**Managing Multiple Referrers**

* Add as many referrers as needed using the "Add Referrer" button
* Traffic Buddy will cycle through all enabled referrers sequentially
* Each new simulated visitor will use the next referrer in the cycle
* Use drag-and-drop to prioritize referrer order

üìù **Note:** At least one traffic source must be configured for the campaign to start.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Ensure your custom URLs are properly formatted and accessible to avoid campaign errors.&#x20;

üí° **Tip:** Mix different referrer types to create more realistic traffic patterns.

#### Browser Actions Tab

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Add-Actions.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Browser Actions Tab - Create your visitor's journey step by step</p></figcaption></figure>

In this tab, you configure the sequence of actions that each simulated visitor will perform. Actions are executed in order from top to bottom, creating realistic user behavior patterns.

**‚≠ê 1. Primary Action: Visit URL**

**\[REQUIRED]** This is the fundamental action that must be included in your campaign.

* Initiates the primary navigation to your target website
* Must be the first action in your sequence
* Without this action, the browser cannot reach your target URL
* Format: `https://www.yourwebsite.com`

2. **Wait / Delay**

* Simulates a user spending time on a page
* Configuration:
  * Duration: Set time in seconds
  * Random variation: Optional +/- seconds for natural behavior
* Example: Wait 30 seconds (¬±5 seconds) to simulate reading content

**3. Visit Random Link**

* Automatically finds and clicks a random link on the current page
* Configuration:
  * Wait time: How long to stay on the resulting page
  * Optional: Link pattern filtering
* Simulates natural website exploration

**4. Click Element**

* Performs targeted clicks on specific page elements
* Configuration:
  * Selector type: CSS or JavaScript
  * Element selector: Enter the specific selector
  * Wait time after click
* Example selectors:
  * CSS: `#submit-button` or `.nav-link`
  * JavaScript:`.class-name`

üìù **Note:** Always start with the Visit URL action as your first step.&#x20;

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Actions are executed sequentially. Ensure proper wait times between actions for realistic behavior.&#x20;

üí° **Tip:** Combine different actions to create natural-looking user journeys through your website.

#### Browser Settings Tab

The Browser Settings Tab contains essential configuration options that control how the browser instances behave during your traffic campaign.

**Hide Browser Windows**

  * Creating more realistic traffic patterns
  * Testing geo-specific content
* ‚ö†Ô∏èWhen enabled proxy servers need to be configured (see Proxy Settings)

**Browser Timeout**

* Specifies maximum time (in seconds) for browser operations
* Default: 120 seconds
* Applies to:
  * Page loading
  * Navigation between pages
* If timeout is reached, browser instance continues with next action

üìù **Note:** Lower timeout values may cause premature action termination on slower websites or with slow proxy servers.&#x20;

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** When running many concurrent browsers, keeping the "Hide Browser Windows" option enabled is recommended for better performance.&#x20;

üí° **Tip:** Start with default settings and adjust based on your specific needs and system capabilities.
