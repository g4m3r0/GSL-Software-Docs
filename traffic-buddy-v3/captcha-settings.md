# Captcha Settings

### Overview

The CAPTCHA SOLVING SETTINGS page allows you to integrate a third-party, automatic CAPTCHA solving service with the application. When configured, the application can delegate CAPTCHA challenges to this service, which solves them and sends back the solution. This enables smoother, uninterrupted operation when navigating websites that are protected by CAPTCHAs.To use this functionality, you must first register and have an active account with one of the supported CAPTCHA solving providers.
