<summary>I'm getting an error that my license key is invalid. What could be causing this issue?</summary>

There are a few potential causes for this issue:

1. Check your internet connection to ensure that you have a stable connection. This is necessary for the program to verify your license key.
2. Make sure that there are no extra spaces before or after the license key. Sometimes when copying and pasting, these spaces can be inadvertently added and can cause the key to be invalid.
3. Check to make sure that you are entering the correct license key. If you have multiple keys or are unsure which key to use, it might be helpful to double-check with whoever provided the key or with our support team.

If you've tried all of these steps and are still having issues with your license key, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team for further assistance.

2. Install Traffic Buddy on the new device and enter your license key to activate it.

<summary>How many visits can I generate per hour with Traffic Buddy?</summary>

The number of visits you can generate per hour depends on several factors:

* **System resources:** You’ll need approximately **8 GB of RAM for every 100 browser instances**. A powerful CPU is also required — ideally **8 cores, 16 threads (8c/16t)**.
* **Campaign actions:** The more actions your campaign requires (e.g., clicks, scrolling, waiting), the longer each visit takes, which reduces total visits per hour.
* **Website performance:** Visits take longer to complete on complex websites or when using slow proxies, which can further limit throughput.

Example: With an estimated view time of 10 seconds per visit, you will reach 6 visits per minute leading to 360 visits per hour with 1 concurrent browser

* 1 concurrent browser: 360 visits per hour
* 100 concurrent browsers: 36000 visits per hour
* 1000 concurrent browsers: 360000 visits per hour

In short, the exact visits per hour vary depending on your **hardware, campaign design and website speed**.&#x20;
