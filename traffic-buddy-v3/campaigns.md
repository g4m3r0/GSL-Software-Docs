## Add a new Campaign

Traffic Buddy allows you to create customized traffic campaigns to generate realistic visitor behavior for your website . Here's a detailed guide on how to set up a new campaign using the different configuration tabs.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Add-Campaign.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Press the "+" button to add a new traffic campaign</p></figcaption></figure>

### General Settings Tab

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/campaign general.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Add a new Campaign: General Settings</p></figcaption></figure>

The General Settings tab contains the basic configuration options for your traffic campaign. Here you'll define the campaign's core parameters that determine its identity and scale.

**Campaign ID**

* An automatically generated unique identifier for your campaign
* Used for tracking and referencing your campaign within Traffic Buddy

**Campaign Name**

* Enter a descriptive name for your campaign
* This name helps you identify your campaign in the campaign list
* Example: "Summer Sale Landing Page Traffic" or "Product Page Testing"

**Maximum Concurrent Browsers**

* Defines how many browser instances can run simultaneously
* Each browser instance simulates one unique visitor
* Valid range: 1 to 1000 browsers
* Higher numbers generate more concurrent traffic but require more system resources
* Recommended: Start with a lower number and increase gradually based on your system's performance

üìù **Note:** Consider your system resources when setting concurrent browsers and maximum views. Higher numbers may require more powerful hardware.&#x20;

**Maximum Total Views**

* Sets the total number of page views the campaign will generate
* Campaign stops automatically when this number is reached
* Example: Setting this to 1000 means the campaign will stop after generating 1000 page views

**Maximum Views per Hour**

* Sets the total number of page views the campaign will generate per hour
* The campaign will be paused when this number has been reached
* The campaign will be started on the next hour

**Maximum Views per Day**

* Sets the total number of page views the campaign will generate per day
* The campaign will be paused when this number has been reached
* The campaign will be started on the next day

### Traffic Origin Tab

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Add-Referrer.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Traffic Origin Configuration - Define how visitors reach your website</p></figcaption></figure>

The Traffic Origin Tab allows you to configure how visitors appear to arrive at your website. You can simulate different traffic sources that reflect realistic user behavior patterns.

You can configure multiple referrer sources that Traffic Buddy will cycle through during the campaign.

**1. Direct Traffic**

* Simulates visitors who type your URL directly into their browser
* No referrer information is sent
* Represents users who have bookmarked your site or received the link through messaging apps
* Toggle: Enable/Disable direct traffic

**2. Search Engine Traffic**

* Simulates visitors coming from search engine results
* Includes the search keyword in the referrer data
* Configuration fields:
  * Search Engine (e.g., Google, Bing)
  * Search Keyword(s)
* Example: A visitor searching "best running shoes" on Google

**3. Custom URL Referrers**

* Simulates visitors coming from specific websites
* Enter one URL per line
* Format: `https://www.example.com`
* Useful for simulating:
  * Social media traffic
  * Partner website referrals
  * Blog post references

**Managing Multiple Referrers**

* Add as many referrers as needed using the "Add Referrer" button
* Traffic Buddy will cycle through all enabled referrers sequentially
* Each new simulated visitor will use the next referrer in the cycle
* Use drag-and-drop to prioritize referrer order

üìù **Note:** At least one traffic source must be configured for the campaign to start.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Ensure your custom URLs are properly formatted and accessible to avoid campaign errors.&#x20;

üí° **Tip:** Mix different referrer types to create more realistic traffic patterns.

### Browser Actions Tab

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/campaign actions.png" alt="Automated Browser Action Flow"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Browser Settings Tab

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/campaign browsersettings.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Browser Settings Configuration - Control core browser behavior and performance options</p></figcaption></figure>

The Browser Settings Tab contains essential configuration options that control how the browser instances behave during your traffic campaign.

**Hide Browser Windows**

* Toggle ON/OFF (Enabled by default)
* When enabled: Browsers run in the background without visible windows
* When disabled: Browser windows are visible on screen
* Use cases for disabling:
  * Debugging campaign behavior
  * Monitoring visitor actions in real-time
  * Testing new action sequences
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** When running many concurrent browsers, keeping the "Hide Browser Windows" option enabled is recommended for better performance.&#x20;

**Use Proxy Servers**

* Toggle ON/OFF
* When enabled: Traffic is routed through proxy servers
* Helps distribute traffic across different IP addresses
* Useful for:
  * Avoiding IP-based rate limiting
  * Creating more realistic traffic patterns
  * Testing geo-specific content
* ‚ö†Ô∏èWhen enabled proxy servers need to be configured (see Proxy Settings)

**Restart Actions on Failture**

* When one action fails within the action flow it wont be counted as views

* Useful for:
  * Problems with proxy servers (rate limited or down)
  * Failed to solve captcha
  * Site didn't load properly

**Browser Timeout**

* Specifies maximum time (in seconds) for browser operations
* Default: 120 seconds
* Applies to:
  * Page loading
  * Navigation between pages
* If timeout is reached, browser instance continues with next action

üìù **Note:** Lower timeout values may cause premature action termination on slower websites or with slow proxy servers.&#x20;

üí° **Tip:** Start with default settings and adjust based on your specific needs and system capabilities.

**Low Bandwidth Mode**

* Blocks resources like images, fonts and media to lower the bandwidth consumtion
* This is especially useful when using residential proxies or other proxies
